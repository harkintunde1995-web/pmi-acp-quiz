The correct agile approach is negotiation \u2014 the PO and team collaborate to adjust scope while protecting sprint goals. The PO decides WHAT, the team decides HOW MUCH.

Together they likely solve 80% of the problem with minimal disruption. Pair programming (option 3) is a larger process change that may be unnecessary if 1+2 are sufficient. Implementing all three simultaneously (option A) makes it impossible to determine which change drove improvement.",

      "explanation": "Kaizen (\u6539\u5584, \"change for better\"): continuous, small improvements by everyone at every level. Daily, incremental, grassroots. Examples: tweaking standups, improving code review process, adjusting WIP limits. Kaikaku (\u6539\u9769, \"radical change\"): infrequent, large-scale transformation driven by leadership. Examples: adopting SAFe across the organisation, restructuring around value streams, replacing the tech stack. Both are part of Lean thinking: Kaizen prevents stagnation between Kaikaku events, and Kaikaku addresses structural issues beyond Kaizen's reach.",

      "explanation": "Walter Shewhart's control charts (adopted by Deming) distinguish between: Common Cause variation (inherent process variation \u2014 do not react to individual data points) and Special Cause variation (assignable cause \u2014 investigate and address). With data ranging from 2-8 historically, 6 is within the historical range and may be common cause variation. However, if the declining trend created a new baseline (recent sprints: 2-3 average), then 6 may exceed the upper control limit. The team should plot the data, calculate control limits, and decide rationally rather than reacting emotionally. Over-reacting to common cause variation (tampering) can actually destabilise a process.",

        "B": "A balanced set: (1) Flow metrics (cycle time, lead time, throughput) for delivery performance; (2) Quality metrics (defect rate, escaped defects, test coverage) for build quality; (3) Team health metrics (engagement scores, retrospective action item completion rate) for sustainability; (4) Value metrics (feature adoption rate, NPS, outcome achievement) for customer impact \u2014 no single metric tells the full story",

      "explanation": "Comprehensive team health requires balanced metrics across four dimensions: Flow (are we delivering efficiently?), Quality (are we building well?), Team (are we sustainable and improving?), Value (are we making a difference?). Optimising one at the expense of others creates dysfunction: high velocity with low quality, fast delivery of low-value features, or unsustainable pace that burns out the team.

      "explanation": "This question addresses the fundamental Agile belief in continuous improvement as a permanent practice, not a remedial one. Agile Principle 12 does not say \"reflect when things go wrong\" \u2014 it says \"at regular intervals.\" High-performing teams derive different value from retrospectives: instead of fixing problems (which are rare), they explore innovations, challenge comfortable patterns, deepen collaboration, and prevent the subtle complacency that causes high-performing teams to gradually regress.
